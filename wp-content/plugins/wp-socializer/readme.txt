## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I insert share icons anywhere in a custom location ?

Yes, you can use Shortcodes. WP Socializer has shortcodes for share icons, profile icons and for share links. Using those shortcodes you can add social sharing features anywhere in your site.

### Is it possible to change the icon to custom image if I don't like ?

Yes. In case you didn't like any icon, you can create or used other image and provide the image URL.

### Is this plugin GDPR complaint ?

Yes, WP Socializer does not collect any personal information of you or your visitors. If you have any concerns please do let me know.

### Can I add twitter timeline/tweets to the sidebar ?

Yes, the plugin has out of the box widgets for Facebook, Twitter and social profile links. You can use them and add those widgets to the sidebar.

### Does the plugin slow down my website ?

No. WP socializer is very lite an fast plugin. Except font icons, no external resources are loaded. Also the JS are loaded dynamically only when needed. Since all the resources are loaded locally, if you have a minify plugin you can merge JS/CSS files with other resources of your theme.

### Is it possible to automatically hide share icons in small screens upon resize ?

Yes. WP Socializer uses JS to detect the screen size so you can resize the window to see how responsive the icons are on desktop and mobile devices.

### Some icons are not displayed correctly and a empty square is seen

This happens when the font icon used by the theme and the plugin are of different fontawesome icon versions (v4 and v5). You can try going to WP Socializer --> Settings --> Font icon and select a different font icon version (or) you can disable font icon being loaded completely by `fa_icons` to "CSS/JS to not to load in any page". Please raise a support topic if issue still exists.

### Why are the share icons not aligned properly ?

Share icons are aligned using CSS. This alignment can sometimes be disturbed by the active theme used. This can be corrected by CSS. Please refer [this image](https://goo.gl/Ge7riC#css-classes) for the list of CSS classes used by plugin to modify it or else please post your issue in the [support forum](https://www.aakashweb.com/forum/discuss/wordpress-plugins/wp-socializer/) I'll try my best to give a quick CSS fix for the misalignment.

### Share icons are not displayed in the page !

Share icons or other feature may be hidden if the option "Hide in all pages" option is selected in "Conditions to display" section. Please select "Show in all pages" option to display the buttons. If the buttons are still not displayed, please raise an issue in the Support forum.

### How to disable a feature in specific page alone ? ### 

WP Socializer has a feature called "conditional display" where a feature can be made to shown only at desired places by creating rules. Please look for the section "Conditions to display the template" under every feature page to add rules as per the requirement.

### How to disable/hide share icons in all pages ? ### 

Please select "Hide in all pages" option under "conditions to display the template" section in all the templates to hide them being displayed. For other features like floating sharebar, follow bar, text sharebar and mobile sharebar can be hidden by "disabling" them from the top most section available at their respective pages.

### How to add a custom share button which is not available already to the template ?

Custom share buttons can be added using the "Custom HTML" service. Paste your button generation script in the text box and use that custom HTML button in the template.
