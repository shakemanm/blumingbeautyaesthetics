= Gamified Pop ups =
An easy-to-use gamified popup builder you can easily integrate to your website. Poptin’s new gamified popups allow you to create three kinds: spin the wheel pop ups, scratch card popups, and gift pop ups. These pop ups are ideal for WooCommerce stores.

Generate more leads and encourage more sales by giving customers an engaging way to earn coupon codes and special offers from you!

We’ve made three different kinds of gamified pop ups for you to offer to your visitors. More games, more fun, and more chances of winning.

Here are three kinds of popups we’ve created for you:

* Spin to win pop up
* Scratch card pop up
* Pick a gift pop up

Wheel of fortune pop ups or spin wheel pop ups let your visitors spin a wheel and get the chance to win one of the many prizes or codes on your wheel. Use the wheel of fortune pop up or spin wheel popup for almost always win situation for your visitors. 

Scratch off pop ups or scratch card pop ups are where you set a code and the customer will "scratch" the card to reveal the code for your customers to use in your shop. Use a scratch off popup for that lottery card feel. There’s always a code that customers will win with the scratch cards popups.

Pick a gift pop ups let your customers pick from one of three gifts for a chance to win a special code that can be used in your store. Use the gift pop ups if you want a bit of more thrill, with the visitors getting a chance to win a code or nothing at all.

Appeal to the kids in your customers by adding gamified pop ups on your website.
